E-discovery involves the identification, collection, review, and production of electronic documents and data during the discovery phase of a legal case. AI can be used to automate many of these tasks, making the e-discovery process faster, more accurate, and less expensive.

### Document Review

AI tools can be used to automatically identify relevant documents and information during the document review process. This can save legal professionals a significant amount of time and reduce the risk of missing important information.

### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding involves using machine learning algorithms to code documents as either relevant or irrelevant based on a set of training data. This can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with manual document review.

### Data Visualization

Data visualization tools can be used to create visual representations of large data sets, making it easier for legal professionals to identify patterns and trends.

Litigation Support
